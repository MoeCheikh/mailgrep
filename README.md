## MailGrep - Email OSINT (In Progress...)

MailGrep is an OSINT web app that provided a domain can enumerate email addresses and their information (ip,hostname,country,...) from different public sources (search engines, pgp key servers and shodan) and check them against Shodan.io and haveibeenpwned.com API to uncover potential leaks. This is a very intuitive and affective application for the early stages of an OSIT investigation or just to know the visibility of your company's email domain on the Internet.
